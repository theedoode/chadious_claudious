# üéØ HackBot Edition - Claude Code Offensive Security Framework

‚ö†Ô∏è **PRIVATE REPOSITORY - AUTHORIZED ACCESS ONLY** ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Transform Claude Code into an intelligence-driven offensive security powerhouse.**

HackBot Edition is a comprehensive offensive security framework for Claude Code implementing chain-of-hypothesis research methodology, specialized tool agents, and modern attack vector development for ethical security research and bug bounty hunting.

**This repository is private for security reasons:**
- Prevents bad actors from weaponizing advanced AI-driven attack techniques
- Avoids forcing model providers to implement restrictive mitigations
- Ensures responsible disclosure practices are maintained
- Access limited to vetted security researchers with authorization

## üéì Usage

### Basic Workflow

1. **Start with Intelligence Requirement**
   ```
   User: "I need to enumerate gRPC endpoints and check for reflection API exposure on target.com"
   ```

2. **Claude Code Delegates to Research Chain**
   - Security Researcher forms competing hypotheses
   - Documentation Researcher verifies against gRPC documentation
   - EthiHaxor Dev develops modern attack vectors
   - Recon Specialist coordinates tool specialists

3. **Tool Specialists Execute**
   - nmap-specialist: Port scan for gRPC services
   - curl-specialist: Test reflection API
   - httpx-specialist: Technology detection

4. **Report Back to User**
   - Actionable intelligence
   - Attack surface summary
   - Testing recommendations

### Example: API Reconnaissance

```
User: "Analyze the API at https://api.example.com for vulnerabilities"

Claude Code:
- Security Researcher: Forms hypotheses about API structure
- Documentation Researcher: Verifies against API standards
- Recon Specialist: Delegates to specialists
  ‚Üí httpx-specialist: Tech stack detection
  ‚Üí ffuf-specialist: Endpoint discovery
  ‚Üí nuclei-specialist: CVE scanning
  ‚Üí gau-specialist: Historical endpoint discovery
- EthiHaxor Dev: Develops attack vectors based on findings
- POC Parrot: Retrieves relevant exploit code

Result: Comprehensive API attack surface analysis with working exploits
```

### Using Slash Commands

```bash
# Document findings in structured format
/dox

# Realign to CLAUDE.md principles (if globally installed)
/refocus
```

### Agent Communication

- **Human-in-Loop**: Every stage reports back to user for oversight
- **Not Automation**: Optimization and enhancement, not blind automation
- **Intelligence-Driven**: Every action answers a specific question
- **Evidence-Based**: PROVE IT methodology from CLAUDE.md

## üî¨ Methodology

### Chain-of-Hypothesis (from CLAUDE.md)

**Core Principles:**
- Form competing hypotheses, not definitive conclusions
- Use probabilistic language ("suggests", "indicates", "appears")
- Maintain outcome indifference (avoid confirmation bias)
- Require multi-source verification (2-3 independent sources)
- Distinguish observed ‚Üí documented ‚Üí inferred evidence

**Example Output:**
```
PRIMARY HYPOTHESIS:
gRPC reflection API appears exposed based on port 50051 responding to HTTP/2 preface.
Likelihood: HIGH - observed direct protocol handshake

COMPETING HYPOTHESES:
1. Custom protocol on port 50051 (LOW - HTTP/2 SETTINGS frame confirms gRPC)
2. Honeypot service (MEDIUM - requires further testing for deception indicators)

WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE IF:
- Port was filtered at network level
- Service required TLS client certificate authentication

NEXT STEPS:
1. Test grpcurl for service enumeration
2. Check for rate limiting with concurrent requests
```

### Intelligence-Driven Enumeration

**NOT This:**
```bash
nmap -p- target.com  # Blind port scan
nuclei -t cves/ -l all_targets.txt  # Spray and pray
```

**Instead This:**
```
Objective: Identify gRPC services for protobuf exploitation
Context: Looking for ports 50051-50055 based on tech stack analysis
Action: nmap -Pn -sV -p 50051-50055 target.com
```

## üéØ Tool Specialist Best Practices

Each specialist follows offensive security best practices:

### curl-specialist
```bash
# ALWAYS use -L -vv
curl -L -vv https://target.com
```

### nmap-specialist
```bash
# 90% of recon uses -Pn -sV
nmap -Pn -sV target.com
```

### httpx-specialist
```bash
# Common with subfinder
subfinder -d target.com -silent | httpx -tech-detect -status-code -title -waf
```

### nuclei-specialist
```bash
# Targeted templates, not blind scanning
nuclei -u target.com -t cves/2024/ -tags apache
```

### ffuf-specialist
```bash
# ALWAYS filter by size/status to avoid false positives
ffuf -u https://target.com/FUZZ -w wordlist.txt -mc 200,301,302 -fs 1234
```
