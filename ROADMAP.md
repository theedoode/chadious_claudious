## üîÑ Phase 2: MCP Integration (CURRENT PRIORITY)

**Philosophy**: Can't half-ass this. MCP = structured data and accuracy over Bash text parsing.

### Why MCP Over Bash?
**Bash Limitations:**
- ‚úÖ Works: One-shot commands (`msfvenom`, `curl`, `nuclei`)
- ‚ùå Doesn't work: Interactive sessions (Meterpreter, browser automation)
- ‚ùå Hard to parse: Raw text output instead of structured JSON
- ‚ùå No state management: Can't background/resume sessions
- ‚ùå Limited capability: No browser automation, no proxy integration

**MCP Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Session management (Meterpreter, workspace persistence)
- ‚úÖ Structured data (JSON responses, not grep parsing)
- ‚úÖ Browser automation (screenshots, DOM, JS execution)
- ‚úÖ Proxy integration (Burp history, scanner, repeater)
- ‚úÖ State persistence (database workspaces, saved sessions)

### 2.1: Burp Suite MCP (HIGHEST PRIORITY) üéØ

**Why First**: Already familiar from Caido MCP, one-click install, immediate value

**Official Extension**: PortSwigger BApp Store

**Installation**:
```bash
# Option 1: One-click from Burp
Extensions ‚Üí BApp Store ‚Üí "MCP Server" ‚Üí Install

# Option 2: Claude Code
claude mcp add portswigger/burp-mcp
```

**Capabilities**:
- Access proxy history programmatically
- Run scanner on discovered endpoints
- Use intruder for parameter fuzzing
- Repeater integration for exploit testing
- Automated vulnerability analysis (SQL injection, XSS, LFI, etc.)
- Multi-tool orchestration

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Install PortSwigger Burp MCP extension
- [ ] Verify MCP server running (`claude mcp list`)
- [ ] Test proxy history access
- [ ] Test scanner integration
- [ ] Test intruder automation
- [ ] Test repeater control
- [ ] Create usage examples for recon-specialist delegation
- [ ] Document Burp MCP patterns in specialist agent (if needed)

**Success Criteria**:
- Can query Burp proxy history via MCP
- Can trigger scanner on specific endpoints
- Can automate intruder attacks
- Structured JSON responses (not Bash text parsing)

---

### 2.2: Playwright MCP (HIGH PRIORITY) üåê

**Why Second**: Browser automation = massive capability unlock

**Official Repository**: `github.com/microsoft/playwright-mcp`

**Installation**:
```bash
claude mcp add microsoft/playwright-mcp
```

**Capabilities**:
- Browser automation (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- Screenshot capture (visual confirmation)
- DOM inspection and manipulation
- JavaScript execution in browser context
- Form filling and authenticated browsing
- API testing (GET/POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE)
- Accessibility snapshots (no vision models needed)
- Headless or visible browser mode

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Install Microsoft official playwright-mcp
- [ ] Test screenshot capture
- [ ] Test DOM inspection
- [ ] Test authenticated browsing (cookie/session handling)
- [ ] Test form filling and JS execution
- [ ] Test API request interception
- [ ] Create browser-specialist agent (or enhance recon-specialist)
- [ ] Document Playwright MCP patterns

**Success Criteria**:
- Can automate browser interactions
- Can capture screenshots for visual verification
- Can handle authenticated sessions
- Can execute JS in browser context

**Use Cases**:
- Visual confirmation of XSS
- Automated authenticated fuzzing
- DOM-based vulnerability testing
- Client-side JavaScript analysis
- Session token extraction
- Bypassing client-side protections

### 2.3: Chrome MCP (HIGH PRIORITY) üåê

**Why Third**: Uses your actual Chrome browser with extensions, persistent sessions, anti-bot detection

**Repository**: `github.com/hangwin/mcp-chrome`
**Stars**: 8.7k ‚≠ê (Most popular community Chrome MCP)
**License**: MIT

**Installation**:
```bash
# Download extension from GitHub releases
# Install bridge
npm install -g mcp-chrome-bridge
# Load extension in Chrome
```

**Capabilities**:
- **Uses your daily Chrome** (existing profile, logins, extensions)
- Persistent authenticated sessions (no re-login)
- Cookie Editor, Wappalyzer, JSON Viewer compatibility
- Network monitoring, bookmarks, screenshots
- Content analysis, web scraping
- Fully local, privacy-focused

**Why Better Than Playwright for Security Testing**:
- Real browser fingerprint (stealth, anti-bot)
- Keep your extensions (Cookie Editor, etc.)
- Persistent sessions across tests
- Faster startup (no new browser instances)

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Install hangwin/mcp-chrome
- [ ] Configure Chrome extension
- [ ] Test with existing Chrome profile
- [ ] Verify extension compatibility (Cookie Editor, etc.)
- [ ] Test authenticated session persistence
- [ ] Configure Burp proxy integration (127.0.0.1:8080)
- [ ] Document Chrome MCP patterns

**Success Criteria**:
- Can control existing Chrome with AI
- Extensions work during automation
- Sessions persist across tests
- Traffic proxies through Burp

**Use Cases**:
- Bug bounty testing with authenticated sessions
- Using security testing extensions during automation
- Avoiding bot detection
- Multi-account testing with persistent logins

### 2.4: Metasploit MCP (MEDIUM PRIORITY) üí£

**Why Fourth**: Bash handles 80% already (payload generation, one-shot exploits), MCP adds session management

**Repository**: `github.com/GH05TCREW/MetasploitMCP`
**Downloads**: 41.2k+
**Released**: April 14, 2025

**Installation**:
```bash
claude mcp add GH05TCREW/MetasploitMCP
```

**Configuration**:
- Requires Metasploit RPC endpoint
- Configure `~/.msf4/` for workspace persistence

**Capabilities**:
- Search and list exploit/payload modules
- Configure and execute exploits
- Run auxiliary and post-exploitation modules
- Generate payload files
- **Session management** (the key feature Bash can't do)
- Database/workspace integration
- Structured JSON responses

**What Bash Can Already Do**:
- ‚úÖ `msfvenom` payload generation
- ‚úÖ Single exploit execution
- ‚úÖ Auxiliary module scanning

**What Only MCP Can Do**:
- ‚ùå Meterpreter session management (background, interact, resume)
- ‚ùå Database workspace persistence
- ‚ùå Multi-session orchestration
- ‚ùå Post-exploitation module coordination

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Install GH05TCREW/MetasploitMCP
- [ ] Configure Metasploit RPC endpoint
- [ ] Test Meterpreter session management (background/interact)
- [ ] Test database/workspace integration
- [ ] Test post-exploitation module execution
- [ ] Update metasploit-specialist to use MCP for sessions
- [ ] Keep Bash for simple payload generation (faster)

**Success Criteria**:
- Can manage multiple Meterpreter sessions
- Can background and resume sessions
- Can coordinate post-exploitation modules
- Workspace persistence across sessions

---

### 2.5: Agent Integration Strategy (HYBRID APPROACH)

**Philosophy**: Best tool for the job - Bash for speed, MCP for capability

**Delegation Decision Tree**:
```
User Request ‚Üí Recon-Specialist Analyzes
‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ Needs Meterpreter session management? ‚Üí Metasploit MCP
‚îú‚îÄ Needs authenticated browser testing with extensions? ‚Üí Chrome MCP
‚îú‚îÄ Needs clean-state browser automation? ‚Üí Playwright MCP
‚îú‚îÄ Needs Burp proxy/scanner integration? ‚Üí Burp MCP
‚îî‚îÄ Simple command execution? ‚Üí Bash specialist (faster)
```

**Implementation**:
- [ ] Update recon-specialist delegation logic:
  - Check MCP availability before delegation
  - Fallback to Bash if MCP not available
  - Use Bash for simple, fast commands
  - Use MCP for complex, stateful operations
- [ ] Add MCP availability checks in recon-specialist
- [ ] Create MCP usage documentation
- [ ] Test hybrid workflows (Bash + MCP together)

**Example Workflow**:
```
1. User: "Enumerate gRPC endpoints and test for exploits"
2. Recon-specialist ‚Üí nmap-specialist (Bash: fast port scan)
3. Recon-specialist ‚Üí curl-specialist (Bash: quick reflection test)
4. Recon-specialist ‚Üí metasploit-specialist (MCP: session management)
5. Metasploit MCP ‚Üí Background Meterpreter session
6. Recon-specialist ‚Üí Report findings to user
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Debt & Future Enhancements

### Known Limitations

- **MCP Dependency**: Requires external services (Burp, Playwright, Metasploit) to be running
- **No Caching**: Repeated delegations re-process same information
- **Single-Threaded**: Can't parallelize MCP operations yet

### Future Enhancements
- **Agent Memory**: Persistent context across sessions (database-backed)
- **Caching Layer**: Cache common reconnaissance results
- **Parallel Execution**: Run multiple MCP operations concurrently
- **Custom MCP Servers**: Build HackBot-specific MCP servers for common tasks
- **Output Summarization**: Auto-summarize verbose tool outputs
- **Learning System**: Track successful attack patterns and recommend them
