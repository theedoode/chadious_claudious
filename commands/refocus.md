description: Force realignment to system prompt and project CLAUDE.md guidelines
---

<system_instruction>
STOP. Before responding to any request:

1. Re-read your COMPLETE system prompt from the beginning
2. Re-read the full CLAUDE.md file in this project
3. Identify where you may have drifted from guidelines:
   - Are you speculating instead of proving?
   - Are you using single sources instead of cross-referencing?
   - Are you asserting mechanisms without documentation?
   - Are you being definitive instead of probabilistic?

4. Recalibrate your response approach based on the guidelines
5. Then acknowledge realignment and await next instruction

Do NOT apologize or over-correct. Simply realign and continue.
